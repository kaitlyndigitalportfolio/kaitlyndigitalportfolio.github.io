      <p>What is my smart goal and how can I achieve it?</p>
      
      
    <hr><p> Hello, my name is Kaitlyn Podlich, I'm in 8th grade, and have been a Rhoades for almost nine years. This year I've had the pleasure to create my own personal website to document my progress. Using my Khan Academy and Brackets knowledge I've been able to code and design a website to share with you all today. </p>

    <hr><p> Smart Goal</p>
    <p> For many years I have struggled with grammar, and my papers I've written in the past had been impacted due to my grammatical errors. This year I have taken it upon myself to improve my grammar and sentence structure overall. Throughout this year I have been working on online tutoring programs such as Khan Academy and reading more advanced literature; such as To Kill a Mockingbird and Fahrenheit 451. I’ve seen an improvement in my writing, and my grammar no longer has a negative impact on my essay grade. Now that it is 2020, instead of doing non intriguing exercises to improve, I really want to branch out read new exciting books such as Pride and Predigest by Jane Austen or Emma by Jane Austen. With these modifications to my plan, I hope by the beginning of high school I will have above average grammar and sentence structure.  </p>
    
<hr><p> Stretch:</p>
    <p> My stretch is essay organization, which I’m pleased to say have remained only partially relevant so far. The organization of an essay can make or break an essay, which was why I thought it would be a good idea to try to develop more effective organizational habits and methods. I am becoming more aware of deadlines, I'm writing important details down, and go to school with a clear mind. Although I believe my essay organization has improved from the beginning of the year, and I would like to keep improving at a consistent rate, I would still stay that my stretch has remained a stretch. However, I do have hope that I can still continue to work toward this goal of making my stretch a strength.  </p>
      
<hr><p> Strength:</p>
      <p> I believe my ability to make connections to past events in history is my strength. Analysis always plays a big part in crafting a good essay, and to strengthen an argument one can use past historical events and make connections. I do believe that my strength has still remained constant throughout the year. I also acknowledge that my seesaw post is often a reflection of my strength. As well as my in class analysis of secondary sources for the Odyssey. I believe that my grades have continued to improve as I've embraced my knowledge and continued to make references in my papers. </p> <hr>

  <p> Mid-year Reflection Questions and Responses</p><ol> <li> How broad is your friend group? Are peers easily accepted? What have you done/can you do to improve the social atmosphere within your group of friends, grade-level, or school? My group of friends get along well with each other. We all share common interests, and the people I surround myself with are very accepting and kind. We also make sure to include children from younger grades, give them advice, and allow them to hang with us when they need a friend. </li> <li> How have you contributed to our community this year? Provide examples of any leadership roles you have assumed or how you have been a role model? How have you grown as a leader/role model, or what are some ideas on how to assume these roles in the future? This year I have been really focusing on the National Charity League to give back to the community; which I go into detail on a separate page. This year I would like to eventually participate in Casa de Amistad once my volleyball season ends. I've also secured the role as secretary for the Rhoades School's student council. This puts me and my fellow council members as leaders and examples for the student body. This has helped me grow as a person and I have learned a lot from the experiences I've gotten. </li> <li> Are you consistent with completing work on time? What is hindering/helping you? I would say I am consistent in turning in work on time. Years in the past I've let procrastination get the best of me. So for the rest of this year I am making it my personal goal to continue to turn in work ontime but start producing more quality projects.</li></ol>
