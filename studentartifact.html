      <hr><p> Literature Artifact: Annotated Scarlet Letter Notebook</p>
<p> This year when reading the Scarlet Letter, we were strongly urged to annotate and take notes while reading. Personally, I love annotating books and writing certain points down. I think it reflects my note taking as a student. I think note taking is very important, and having good notes is the foundation of a good essay. It is essential for me to improve my smart goal for this year, which is essay organization. The habit of minds also play a role in my literature artifact: them being organization and striving for accuracy.</p>

      <hr><p> Social Studies Artifact: Give Me Liberty Annotations</p>
<p> Again, annotations are extremely important when making sure one can truly understand the work they are reading. Annotations also help when writing an essay. It helps me truly understand and be able to analyze what the writing is trying to convey. Each week are tasked to read a section of a chapter from GML, and are supposed to annotate a passage or central idea from the page. I've mostly received 3+ or 4s. I think this again relates to my smart goal. Since annotations can help improve and strengthen arguments. It also relates to my strenght, making past connections to events can really strengthen the analysis of an annotation. Annotations are time consuming, and can sometimes be frustrating, so persisting and using critical thinking skills play a role in writing the annotations.</p>

      <hr><p> Math Artifact: Math Journal</p>
<p> In math we have daily lessons, and the contents we are taught can sometimes be confusing. So taking notes is a big help when it comes to retaining the knowledge, and performing better during tests. Writing is one of the ways I learn best, so taking notes in math has always been a must for me. This year I have done a good job at keeping my notes organized and actually using them to help me during tests. Having a journal relates to organization a lot, therefore I believe it can impact my progression on my smart goal. Thinking flexibly, organization, and striving for accuracy play a role in creating useful notes. </p> <hr>

      <hr> <p> Spanish Artifact: Spanish Script</p>
      <p>I have been learning spanish for almost nine years. This year we have been learning preterite and imperfect, which are two forms of past tense. For a mid year project, we were assigned to do a partner project about an angry patient and an oblivious doctor.We had to write it in the present tense, it was supposed to be about a few minutes long. I think this script was extremely important to improve my grammar in Spanish. Having to memorize and read the script out loud also will help improve my fluency. Creating the script relates to thinking flexibly, striving for accuracy, and thinking interdependently.</p> <hr>
