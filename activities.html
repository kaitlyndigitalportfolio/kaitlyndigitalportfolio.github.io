    <hr><p>National Charity League:</p>
      <p> When I was younger I volunteered through the Rhoades School for varying charities such as Feeding San Diego. When I was in 7th grade I finally joined the National Charity League (NCL). It was new but exciting, I spent 12+ hours volunteering at the Del Mar fair both that collected toys for foster kids. I've also done charities for Cystic Fibrosis Runs, Feeding America, and volunteering at local libraries to create toys for dogs. Overall it is a lot of fun to help out the community and I am very thankful I'm able to be a part of this noble cause. It is very important for us to give back to our community through charity and fundraisers. This activity demonstrates thinking flexibly and being empathetic toward others. I think charity over all improves me as a person, and it is definitely something I want to pursue for the rest of my life. </p>

      <hr> <p> Babysitting</p>
      <p> I have two younger siblings, and I've babysat them for a little while now. Ever since I was little I've always wanted to babysit, and so did all my friends. And now that I've done it for a while, I've really begun to enjoy it. I love the sense of responsibility. As I grow I hope to get more babysitting jobs. But for now, I think babysitting demonstrates my habit of minds: being, self directed, precision, communication + collaboration, and critical thinking.</p>
